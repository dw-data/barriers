# Data Sources

## Border walls and fences

We compiled our [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CTzHbi_lkfB29Aae1dw-3xmLCpjphHREJpB-dJm67-k/edit?usp=sharing) cross-referencing four different data sources:

1. Élisabeth Vallet, Josselyn Guillarmou, and Zoé Barry, Raoul-Dandurand Chair, University of Quebec in Montreal (2014), as shown in [The Economist](http://infographics.economist.com/2015/fences/)

2. Centre Dèlas d'Estudis per la Pau (2020): "A walled world" (page 14 ff.) [report as pdf](https://www.tni.org/files/publication-downloads/informe46_walledwolrd_centredelas_tni_stopwapenhandel_stopthewall_eng_def.pdf) 

3. Vernon & Zimmermann (2019): Walls and Fences: A Journey Through History and Economics [pdf](http://www.klausfzimmermann.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2020-200721-Walls-Vernon-Zimmermann-PrepublicationFinal.pdf)

4. Wikipedia article with references on Border barriers, [retrieved on August 4, 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_barrier)

After cross-referencing and validating the information in these datasets, we conducted additional research to identify barriers that were built after these sources published their information. 

If information in these datasets (1-4) was not an exact match between them, additional research was conducted to validate the existence of a border wall or border fence. A border barrier was only included if there were two or more sources for it.

If you spot a mistake in our dataset, please don't hesitate to reach out to data-team@dw.com to refer us to additional sources that we missed.


### Methodological choices

We included barriers both partial ones as well as those along an entire border. If two neighboring countries both built barriers towards each other, they are listed and counted as individual barriers in our dataset, but are only marked with one instead of two lines on the [map](). If there were multiple entries on the same border with distinctive different construction years, those were treated as two separate barriers being built rather than the same.

Note that the existence of a border barrier does not mean all movement across a border is impossible.

If construction of a wall has started but since stopped (eg due to a lack of funding), the barrier will still be listed as "construction started". Barriers were only excluded when there were reports about a change of plan. 

We excluded barriers that were built to prevent animals from migrating and spreading animal diseases (eg Denmark - Germany, Poland - Ukraine).

Although information on a barrier was announced/construction was started/completed was included in some of our initial datasets, we excluded this information from our compilation since we did not double-check whether these dates were correct. We did however use this information in the verification process to figure out if two sources were referring to the same barrier, as some countries have multiple entries for borders on the same barrier.



## Migration data

Data on refugee populations in different regions is based on the [UN International migrant stock 2020 dataset, table 6](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/international-migrant-stock), the documentation for this dataset can be found [here](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/undesa_pd_2020_international_migrant_stock_documentation.pdf). 

Additional information on migration data and trends was taken from the UNHCR report ["Global Trends: Forced displacement in 2019"](https://www.unhcr.org/be/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2020/07/Global-Trends-Report-2019.pdf).
